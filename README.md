# Issues Migration

This is a small script that will migrate bitbucket issues to a github project.
It will use the bitbucket api to pull out the issues and comments.

It will import issues (and close them as needed) and their comments. Labels and
milestones are not supported.

Forked from [vbabiy/bitbucket_issue_migration](https://github.com/vbabiy/bitbucket_issue_migration).
Incorporated code from [jimfulton](https://github.com/jimfulton)'s [PR](https://github.com/vbabiy/bitbucket_issue_migration/pull/22).

## Before running

You will need to install the requirements first

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Usage: migrate.py [options]

    Positional arguments:
      bitbucket_repo        Name of Bitbucket repo to pull data from.
      bitbucket_username    Bitbucket username or organisation name.
      github_username       Your GitHub username

      -t, --dry-run         Preform a dry run and print eveything.
      -f <id>, --start <id> Bitbucket id of the issue to start import (1 means you want all the issues)

personal username, but the appropriate API token for the repository.
